# Miden Crypto
This crate contains cryptographic primitives used in Polygon Miden.

## Hash
[Hash module](./src/hash) provides a set of cryptographic hash functions which are used by the Miden VM and the Miden rollup. Currently, these functions are:

* [BLAKE3](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3) hash function with 256-bit, 192-bit, or 160-bit output. The 192-bit and 160-bit outputs are obtained by truncating the 256-bit output of the standard BLAKE3.
* [RPO](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1577) hash function with 256-bit output. This hash function is an algebraic hash function suitable for recursive STARKs.

For performance benchmarks of these hash functions and their comparison to other popular hash functions please see [here](./benches/).

## Merkle
[Merkle module](./src/merkle/) provides a set of data structures related to Merkle trees. All these data structures are implemented using the RPO hash function described above. The data structures are:

* `MerkleStore`: a collection of Merkle trees of different heights designed to efficiently store trees with common subtrees. When instantiated with `RecordingMap`, a Merkle store records all accesses to the original data.
* `MerkleTree`: a regular fully-balanced binary Merkle tree. The depth of this tree can be at most 64.
* `Mmr`: a Merkle mountain range structure designed to function as an append-only log.
* `PartialMerkleTree`: a partial view of a Merkle tree where some sub-trees may not be known. This is similar to a collection of Merkle paths all resolving to the same root. The length of the paths can be at most 64.
* `SimpleSmt`: a Sparse Merkle Tree (with no compaction), mapping 64-bit keys to 4-element values.
* `TieredSmt`: a Sparse Merkle tree (with compaction), mapping 4-element keys to 4-element values.

The module also contains additional supporting components such as `NodeIndex`, `MerklePath`,  and `MerkleError`  to assist with tree indexation, opening proofs, and reporting inconsistent arguments/state.

## Signatures
[DAS module](./src/dsa) provides a set of digital signature schemes supported by default in the Miden VM. Currently, these schemes are:

* `RPO Falcon512`: a variant of the [Falcon](https://falcon-sign.info/) signature scheme. This variant differs from the standard in that instead of using SHAKE256 hash function in the *hash-to-point* algorithm we use RPO256. This makes the signature more efficient to verify in Miden VM.

For the above signatures, key generation and signing is available only in the `std` context (see [crate features](#crate-features) below), while signature verification is available in `no_std` context as well.

## Crate features
This crate can be compiled with the following features:

* `std` - enabled by default and relies on the Rust standard library.
* `no_std` does not rely on the Rust standard library and enables compilation to WebAssembly.

Both of these features imply the use of [alloc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/) to support heap-allocated collections.

To compile with `no_std`, disable default features via `--no-default-features` flag.

### SVE acceleration
On platforms with [SVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64#Scalable_Vector_Extension_(SVE)) support, RPO hash function can be accelerated by using the vector processing unit. To enable SVE acceleration, the code needs to be compiled with the `sve` feature enabled. This feature has an effect only if the platform exposes `target-feature=sve` flag. On some platforms (e.g., Graviton 3), for this flag to be set, the compilation must be done in "native" mode. For example, to enable SVE acceleration on Graviton 3, we can execute the following:
```shell
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo build --release --features sve
```

## Testing

You can use cargo defaults to test the library:

```shell
cargo test
```

However, some of the functions are heavy and might take a while for the tests to complete. In order to test in release mode, we have to replicate the test conditions of the development mode so all debug assertions can be verified.

We do that by enabling some special [flags](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html) for the compilation.

```shell
RUSTFLAGS="-C debug-assertions -C overflow-checks -C debuginfo=2" cargo test --release
```
